This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Chapter 3

Shopping list (non-labelled items) milk, apple, pork

Here 1, 2 and 3 are not their label. It simply represents the position of the item on the shopping list, which is like the position of element value in a list.

It is like

```{r}
list(
  "milk", 
  "apple", 
  "pork"
)[[1]]
```

Or

```{r}
list(
  Compulsory = 
    c("Principle of Economics", 
      "Calculus", 
      "Accounting"),
  Selective = 
    c("Philosophy", 
      "Chinese Literature")
)[[2]][[2]]
```

Using c because the values are the same type Element name = Element value

Nested list in program

```{r}
list(
  name="Gianandrea Noseda conducts Schumann and Mendelssohn â€” With Mikhail Pletnev",
  time="2021, Oct, 01",
  program=list(
    "Robert Schumann, Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 54",
    "Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Symphony No. 4 in A Major, Op. 90, Italian"
  )
)
```

If you have 2 concerts than you can do it like this

```{r}
list(
  list(
    name="name1",
    time="time1",
    program=list(
      "music1",
      "music2"
    )
  ),
  list(
    name="name2",
    time="time2",
    program=list(
      "musicA",
      "musicB"
    )
  )
)
```

How would you store the following lists:

Shopping list: egg x 2 dozens, milk x 1L, vegetable x 2 kinds.

```{r}
list(
  egg="2 dozens",
  milk="1L",
  vegetables="2kinds"
)
```

Make a list of two courses your take this semester with course name, time, and place

```{r}
list(
  list(
    name="Cross Cultural Class",
    time="10am-12pm",
    place="Humanities Building"),
    list(
      name="Human Resources Class",
      time="1pm-4pm",
      place="Business Building")
    )
```

## Import JSON

press FN+F1 to see on fromJSON

```{r}
# Observation by observation
# Observation by observation
concerts_obo <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("https://cloud.culture.tw/frontsite/trans/SearchShowAction.do?method=doFindTypeJ&category=17", simplifyDataFrame = FALSE)

# Feature by feature
concerts_fbf <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("https://cloud.culture.tw/frontsite/trans/SearchShowAction.do?method=doFindTypeJ&category=17", simplifyDataFrame = TRUE) #open like a spread sheet
```

### 3.2 Retrieve Multiple Element Values

to retrieve one value use double bracket

```{r}
[[1]]
[["element value"]]
```

if you wan to retrieve more use one brecket

```{r}
[ c(1, 2, 5)]
[ c("name 1", "name 2")]
```

```{r}
JohnsFamily <-
  list(
    name = "John", 
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    )
  )
```

how to check element names

```{r}
names(JohnsFamily)
```

```{r}
fncallExample <- list("John", 35, covid19Positive=FALSE)
length(fncallExample)
names(fncallExample)
```

```{r}
Sys.Date() # show the date today
```

```{r}
car() #driving a car ; function call
```

```{r}
car # look inside the car on how it is built
```

```{r}
JohnsFamily[c(1,2)] # first and second element value
# also a list
JohnsFamily[("name","age")]
```

```{r}
source2 <- c(2, 29, 3, 7)
example2 <- source2[c(2,4)]
```

## Exercise 3.2

From concerts_obo,

Retrieve the 3rd and 5th concert observations and bind the result value with an object name concerts_sampled.

For the second concert, what are its first show's time and location? Retrieve the information and bind the value with firstShowInfo.

```{r}
concerts_sampled <- concerts_obo[c(3,5)]
```

```{r}
firstShowInfo <- concerts_obo[[2]][["showInfo"]][[1]][c("time","location")]
```

## 3.3 Replacement

```{r}
JohnsFamily <-
  list(
    name = "John", #1st element; named element name
    age = 35,
    spouse = list(
      name = "Mary", 
      age = 32),
    children = list(
      list(
        name = "Bill", 
        age = 5),
      list(
        name = "Jane", 
        age = 3)
    )
  )
```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy <- JohnsFamily
JohnsFamilyCopy[[1]]
JohnsFamilyCopy[[1]] <- "Watson" 
JohnsFamilyCopy[[1]]

JohnsFamilyCopy[["name"]] <-"John"
JohnsFamilyCopy[[1]]
```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy <- JohnsFamily
# name to "Watson"
JohnsFamilyCopy[["name"]] <- "Watson"
# age to 37
JohnsFamilyCopy[["age"]] <- 37
JohnsFamilyCopy

```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy <- JohnsFamily

# name and age to "Watson" and 37
JohnsFamilyCopy[c("name","age")] <- list(names="Watson",age="37")

JohnsFamilyCopy
```

```{r}
# name and age to "Dickens" and 32

JohnsFamilyCopy[c("name","age")] <-
  list("Dickens","32")

JohnsFamilyCopy
```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy <- JohnsFamily
#spouse age is wrong
JohnsFamilyCopy$spouse$age # or
JohnsFamilyCopy$spouse[["age"]]

# correct it to 33
JohnsFamilyCopy$spouse$age <- 33 #or
33 -> JohnsFamilyCopy$spouse$age
JohnsFamilyCopy$spouse[["age"]]

# the first child's name is wrong
JohnsFamilyCopy$children[[1]]
JohnsFamilyCopy$children[[1]] <- "Gary"
JohnsFamilyCopy$children[[1]]
```

# EXERCISE 3.3

From concerts_obo, due to Covid-19 the 3rd concert's 1st show time is changed to "2022/01/31 19:30:00" and the location is changed to "Taichung Opera House", please change the information

```{r}
concerts_obo[[3]]$showInfo[[1]][c("time","location")]
concerts_obo[[3]]$showInfo[[1]][c("time","location")] <- list(time = "2022/01/31 19:30:00", location = "Taichung Opera House")
```

### 3.4 Add Element Values

Adding an element value is like

Retrieve a non-existent element value and bind a value to it

```{r}
example1 <- c("John", "Mary", "Bill")
# retrieve an non-existing element name "person4"
example1[["person4"]] <- "Ken"
```


```{r}
example1 <- c("John", "Mary", "Bill)
example1[[4]]
example1[[4]] <- "Ken" # binding a value to some non-existent retrieval

# 
example1 <- c("John", "Mary", "Bill)
example1[["person4"]]
example1[["person4"]] <- "Ken"
example1[["person4"]]

# becomes
c("John", "Mary", "Bill")

# retrieve on non-existing element name "person4"
example1[["person4"]] <- "Ken"
```

```{r}
example1 <- c("John", "Mary", "Bill")
example1 <- c("John", "Mary", "Bill","Kevin")
example1[[4]] 
```



```{r}
# retrieve two non-existing element positions
example1[c(7,8)] <- c("person7"="Jack", "Janem")
example1
```


```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy2 <- JohnsFamily
# Add a new born 
```

```{r}
newBorn <- list(
  name="Lisa",
  age=0
)
```

```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy2$children[[3]] <- newBorn
# do name call of newBorn
JohnsFamilyCopy2$children[[3]] <- list(
  name="Lisa",
  age=0
)
```


```{r}
JohnsFamilyCopy2$children[[3]] <- 
  list(name="Lisa", age=0) # $ is for list only
```

### 3.4
```{r}
height <- c("001"=177, "002"=183, "003"=173)

height[["001"]] 
height[["002"]] 
height[["003"]] 
```

```{r}
rm(height)

# if height exists but no following three element
height[["001"]] <- 177
height[["002"]] <- 183
height[["003"]] <- 173
```

* in each line, R does not **name call** first (name call on height)

```{r}
# make height exist here but with no element values
height <- numeric(0) # this step is called declaration
```

```{r}
height[["001"]] <- 177
height[["002"]] <- 183
height[["003"]] <- 173
```

* Declaration makes name call on height have meaning

```{r}
height

```

```{r}
height <- numeric(0) # Declaration

height[["001"]] <- 177 #adding one element values
height[c("002", "003")] <- c(183, 173) #add 2 element values
```

Each type of vector has a different declaration function to call:
```{r}
# declare a numeric object
object_numeric <- numeric(0)
# declare a character object
object_character <- character(0)
# declare a logical object 
object_logical <- logical(0)
```
